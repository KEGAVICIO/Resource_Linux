- First download the packet tracer for cisco

- Then if you use "sudo dpkg -i cisco.deb"

- You see 2 error for libraries

- Then you need to download "sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libxcb-xinerama0-dev"

- If you can download do this:
	- I put the librarie libgl1-mesa-glx in the folder
	- Download this
	- and instal “sudo dpkg -i libl1-mesa-glx”

	- The other librarie install alone “sudo apt-get installa libxcb-xinerama0-dev”
	- You see maybe a error like pls do “--fix-broken install” only do and thats all

- Then you can install you cisco
